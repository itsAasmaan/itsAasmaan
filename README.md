About Me

I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer passionate about building scalable and high-performance web applications.
I specialize in PHP, Laravel, Node.js and Typescript with hands-on experience in creating advanced e-commerce solutions, integrating complex APIs, and optimizing backend performance.

I enjoy problem-solving and have a strong foundation in C++, Data Structures, and Algorithms. Alongside backend development, I also work with frontend technologies like HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and jQuery to deliver complete, end-to-end solutions.
